# C# Minimal API Architecture

This document describes the backend project structure in **C# Minimal API**, organized into layers and modular folders to ensure scalability, testability, and clarity in responsibilities.

---

## 1. Layered Architecture

The backend follows a **modular layered architecture**, organizing components by domain and functionality. Each layer has a defined responsibility, as shown below:

subgraph WebService
    A[Webservice - Presentation Layer]
    B[Moranguinho - Domain Layer]
    C[Shared - Shared Components]
end

subgraph Moranguinho
    B1[Agricultor.cs]
    B2[Propriedade.cs]
    B3[ContextDbFactory.cs]
end

subgraph Shared
    C1[ContextDb - EF Core]
end

A --> B
B --> C

C --> C1

```

### 1.1 Presentation Layer

Located in the `Webservice/` folder.

- Contains the `Program.cs` file, responsible for configuring and exposing HTTP routes, middlewares (Swagger, CORS, authentication), and app services.
- Acts as the UI of the API, handling direct interaction with clients.

### 1.2 Domain Layer

Located in the `Moranguinho/` folder.

- Includes domain-specific logic and models such as `Agricultor.cs`, `Propriedade.cs`, and `ContextDbFactory.cs`.
- Organizes code by feature, improving maintainability and separation of concerns.

### 1.3 Shared Layer

Located in the `Shared/` folder.

- Provides cross-cutting utilities and shared components like models, enums, and helper classes.
- Contains the `ContextDb/` subfolder, which handles database access using EF Core (Entity Framework Core).

This structure enables a clean separation between domain logic, infrastructure, and service exposure.

## 2. Main Folders

### 2.1 Webservice

Service exposure layer of the application.

#### 2.1.1 Program.cs

Initializes and configures the Minimal API app, sets up services, middlewares, and routes.

#### 2.1.2 Endpoints and Middleware

Responsible for exposing routes to external consumers, including Swagger setup, CORS policy, and authentication (if applicable).

---

### 2.2 Moranguinho

Represents the core domain logic.

#### 2.2.1 Agricultor.cs

Defines the `Agricultor` entity and related domain logic.

#### 2.2.2 Propriedade.cs

Represents the `Propriedade` entity, modeling the domain structure for rural properties.

#### 2.2.3 ContextDbFactory.cs

A factory class used to instantiate the `DbContext`, especially useful for dependency injection or testing scenarios.

---

### 2.3 Shared

Shared resources and infrastructure.

#### 2.3.1 ContextDb/

Contains:
- `DbContext` definition used by EF Core
- Entity configurations and model mappings
- Responsible for database interaction (CRUD operations, migrations, etc.)

Used across the entire application to maintain a centralized and consistent data access approach.

## 4. Improvement Points

- **Add Service Layer (optional):** Including a service layer between endpoints and domain classes could improve the separation of business logic. 
- **Program.cs too big:** Create the service layer, and routes configurations
